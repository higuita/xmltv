# programs.  If PerlAPP was run on each one, the total size would be more than
# 12MB, even leaving out PERL56.DLL!

# Perlapp allows you to attach pathed files, but you need the same path
# to access them.  The Makefile creates a text file of these files which is
# used to build a translation table, allowing users to just type the app name
# and not the development path.
