XMLTV 0.6.1, Windows binary release

Gather television listings, process them and organize your viewing.
XMLTV is a file format for storing TV listings, defined in xmltv.dtd.
Then there are several tools to produce and process these listings.

Please see doc\QuickStart for documentation on what each program does,
and xmltv.dtd for documentation on the file format.

This is a release of the software as a single Windows binary
xmltv.exe, generated from the Perl source code linked from
<https://github.com/XMLTV/xmltv>.

* Known problems

Due to prerequisite problems, EXE support is not currently available
for tv_grab_is, tv_grab_pt_meo and tv_grab_it_dvb, If you need one
of those you'll need to install Perl and the necessary modules and
use the full distribution.

tv_grab_se_swedb sometimes fails to work on Windows if there are spaces
in the path to your home-directory. This can be avoided by setting
the environment variable HOME to a path without spaces (e.g. c:\home).

* Major Changes in this release (0.6.1)

* IMPORTANT *

And lots of other changes (see git log for details)

There is no installer, just unpack the zipfile into a
directory such as C:\xmltv.  If you are reading this you've probably
already done that.

All the different programs are combined into a single executable.  For
example, instead of running 'tv_grab_na --days 2 >na.xml' you would run

c:\xmltv\xmltv.exe tv_grab_na_dd --days 2 --output a.xml

Apart from the extra 'xmltv.exe' at the front of each command line,
the usage should be the same as the Unix version.  Some programs make
use of a "share" directory.  That directory is assumed be named
"share" at the same location as the exe.  If you just keep everything
where you unzipped it, everything should be fine.  If you must move
xmltv.exe, you may need to specify a --share option with some
programs.

xmltv.exe will try and guess a timezone.  This usually works fine. If
it doesn't, you can set a TZ variable just like on unix.

* General Windows Notes

Spaces in filenames may cause problems with some programs.  Directories
with spaces (i.e. C:\program files\xmltv) are not recommended.
C:\xmltv is better.

Some of the programs allow you pass a date format on the command line.
This uses % followed by a letter to specify a component of a date, for
example %Y gives a four digit year.  This can cause problems on windows
since % is used as a shell escape character.

To get around this, use %% to pass a % to the application. (ex. %%Y%%M )

If you *DO* want to insert a shell variable, you can do so by surrounding
it with percents. (ex %HOME% )

* Proxy servers

Proxy server support is provide by the LWP modules.

You can define a proxy server via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.
    http_proxy=http://somehost.somedomain:port

For more information, see the following documentation:
    https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent#PROXY-ATTRIBUTES
